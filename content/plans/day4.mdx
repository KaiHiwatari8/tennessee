After two days of hikes, everyone will be pretty much tired to even walk the next day.
**Not me!** I am being adrenaline junkie. So to account for others, the last day has
been reserved for downtown exploration. The closest downtown is Gatlinburg, TN. Gatlinburg
has some adventure sports to enjoy.

Gatlin’s Rugged Ropes Adventure Course is the first of its kind in Gatlinburg. Adventurers,
while safely harnessed in an overhead track, will be able to climb three stories in the air to
face thirty-eight challenges including rickety bridges, suspended ropes and other balancing obstacles.
