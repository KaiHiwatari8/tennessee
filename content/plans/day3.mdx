Once everyone is awake and rejuvenated, we start again from our campsite and hike on some other
notable trails

## Laurel Falls Trail
<Image className="my-4 mx-auto" src="/plans/laurel-falls.webp" width="600" height="200" alt="Chimney top trail" />
Laurel Branch and the 80-foot high Laurel Falls are named for mountain laurel, an evergreen shrub
which blooms along the trail and near the falls in May. The waterfall consists of an upper and a
lower section, divided by a walkway which crosses the stream at the base of the upper falls. Laurel
Falls is one of the most popular destinations in the park and parking at the trailhead is limited.
The area is especially busy on weekends year-round and on weekdays during summer.

## Ramsey Cascades
<Image className="my-4 mx-auto" src="/plans/ramsey-cascades.jpeg" width="600" height="200" alt="Chimney top trail" />
Ramsey Cascades is the tallest waterfall in the park and one of the most spectacular. Water drops 100
feet over rock outcroppings and collects in a small pool where numerous well-camouflaged salamanders can be
found. The trail to the waterfall gains over 2,000' in elevation over its 4 mile course and the 8-mile
roundtrip hike is considered strenuous in difficulty. It follows rushing rivers and streams for much of
its length. The last 2 miles pass through old-growth cove hardwood forest with large tuliptrees, basswoods,
silverbells, and yellow birches.

			Drive six miles east of Gatlinburg on Highway 321 and turn at the Greenbrier

		<td>
			The hike is considered strenuous in difficulty. It takes about 5-7 hours to hike to
			the waterfall and back. Do not climb on rocks around the waterfall. Over the years,
			several people have fallen to their deaths and many others have suffered serious
			injuries from climbing on rocks near waterfalls or along the riverbanks. These rocks
			are slippery due to mist and algae.

60' high Tom Branch Falls located on the far side of Deep Creek. Turn right at the junction with Indian
