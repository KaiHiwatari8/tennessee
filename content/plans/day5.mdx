Three days of hiking and adventure sports sounds very little amount of fun in one summer
but I have got a job that pays for all such fun and my manager pays me if I work. So,
this is day we all shall return back to our houses. Looks like the fun might get over
but by now, I would have gotten some memories with friends and families to cherish.
