<p>The day starts with everyone gathering at a certain decided meeting spot. With around 21 people in
the group, the convoy starts its 12-hours long journey to <span className="text-2xl text-gray-400 font-semibold">Smokey Mountains, TN</span>.
The journey is <span className="text-2xl text-gray-400">~9</span> hours long, by car. The route consists of
taking I-81 South for a major portion. The entire day would succumb to the road trip.</p>
