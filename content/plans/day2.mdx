The plan for the second day is to drive up to and hike some famous trails on the Great Smokey Mountains.
We start with the Visitor's Center and gather information about camping and active bear areas. Following that,
we can take scenic drive on the Newfound Gap Road. The road leads to several interested hikes. To be conservative
of energy, we will start hiking on our way back.

## Chimney Top Trail
<Image className="my-4 mx-auto" src="/plans/chimney.jpeg" width="600" height="200" alt="Chimney top trail" />
The first hike planned is Chimney Top Trail. The Chimney Tops Trail is one of the most popular trails in
Great Smoky Mountains National Park because of its length and spectacular views. The trail gains 1,400
feet in nearly 2 miles which makes for a steep climb, so be sure to wear sturdy shoes and bring plenty of water.
The trail begins by crossing rushing streams three times before ascending the side of the mountain. A steep climb
over a rocky trail leads to a switchback, and the trail then follows along the side of Sugarland Mountain.
A ridge offers a view of Mount Le Conte.

## Clingmans Dome

At 6,643 feet, Clingmans Dome is the highest point in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It is the highest
point in Tennessee, and the third highest mountain east of the Mississippi. Only Mt. Mitchell (6,684 feet)
and Mt. Craig (6,647), both located in Mt. Mitchell State Park in western North Carolina, rise higher. The
observation tower on the summit of Clingmans Dome offers spectacular 360Â° views of the Smokies and beyond for
visitors willing to climb the steep half-mile walk to the tower at the top.

Clouds, precipitation, and cold temperatures are common at Clingmans Dome. Temperatures at the dome can be
10-20 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than in the surrounding lowlands. In fact, the cool, wet conditions on
Clingmans Dome's summit make the spruce-fir forest that grows there a coniferous rainforest. Proper
preparation is essential for a good visit. Dress in layers and be sure to bring a jacket, even in summer.

			Dome Road to the large parking area at the end.

## Alum Cave Bluffs
<Image className="my-4 mx-auto" src="/plans/alum.jpeg" width="600" height="200" alt="Chimney top trail" />

The trail begins by crossing Walker Camp Prong and Alum Cave Creek on log bridges, leading hikers
through an old-growth hardwood forest. Hiking through the narrow tunnel of Arch Rock is a highlight
of the hike. As the trail climbs up Peregrine Peak, it approaches a heath bald full of mountain
laurel and rhododendron, finally reaching a rocky outcrop known as Inspiration Point after 2 miles.
This is a good place to view the rugged valley while surrounded by mountains.

The Alum Cave Bluffs are 2.3 miles from the trailhead. It's hard to believe how dry the ground is
underneath the bluffs when the air and ground outside of it are wet. Many visitors turn around at this
point, but continuing on the trail to the summit of Mount Le Conte will reward you with sweeping vistas
seen from exposed cliffs that the trail follows to the top.

After a day with three hikes, everyone will pretty much be tired. **Except Me!** We will return to our campsite and
sit back and pop open a beer. We will call it a day with a movie night, bonfire, and some fun games.

If the kids are cool, we all might a walk in the night and have fun on our own.
